# Executive Summary

This report documents the recent surge in political protests on university campuses across the United States. Protests have erupted since the Israeli military began bombing and invading the Gaza Strip after October 7th. This project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of these demonstrations by enhancing existing maps with detailed data on specific protests.

The objective of this project is to provide a timeline of major protests, both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli, occurring from October 7th to the end of May. This report highlights the varying demands of protestors, from calling for an end to the war and severing ties with Israel to addressing antisemitism and advocating for the hostages' release.

To achieve my objective, I found a geospatial dataset from the Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) portal that was used to map university locations. I selected 14 universities to analyze major protest activities that have taken place. The research for this project consisted of specific searches to document past and ongoing demonstrations to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the events.

The findings reveal a significant increase in pro-Palestinian demonstrations, with 40 events documented compared to 7 pro-Israeli protests. While I wasn't surprised to see these results, I was surprised to see the many different ways these protests were handled.

University administrations have handled these events in various ways, including police force, communicating with protesters, staying silent, and suspending student groups. Many university presidents have faced critical backlash for their public statements regarding the protests. For instance, after a congressional hearing about antisemitic events, the presidents of Harvard and Penn State faced pressure to resign because of their inadequate response to antisemitism.

This report also discusses limitations faced, including the inability to cover all major universities and potential inaccuracies due to reliance on available articles. Despite these limitations, I believe the documentation of these events provides valuable insights into the current political climate on campuses and can foster constructive discussions.

# Background and Problem Statement

Since October 7th, the start of the Israeli military campaign into the Gaza Strip has sparked numerous protests on university campuses. Both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli demonstrations, as well as counter-protests, have been widespread. Pro-Palestinian protestors, although varying in their specific demands across different universities, commonly call for an end to the war in Gaza, the severing of ties with Israel and companies profiting from the conflict, and transparency in financial holdings. On the contrary, pro-Israeli supporters and counter-protesters advocate for the release of all remaining hostages and address the surge in antisemitism nationwide.

The intensity of these protests has been escalating across the country and globally. Recently, some protesters have occupied university grounds to establish encampments, aiming to raise awareness about the ongoing war in Gaza, particularly the imminent ground invasion of Rafah. These actions have garnered extensive media coverage.

Incidents of antisemitism, building takeovers, and occasional violence have led some university presidents to call in the police to dismantle the encampments. Others have either remained silent or attempted to negotiate with the protesters. Amidst the mayhem, I believe there is a need to document the major events occurring on university campuses comprehensively.

The surge in political protests on university campuses in recent months has been staggering. The media has put a huge focus on promoting these events through their articles and media coverage. Furthermore, certain organizations have created maps to showcase protests across the country and at universities. For instance, CNN came out with an article that has a static map of university protest locations and a list of arrests at each university. The New York Times also came out with a similar article that CNN had posted.

The existing maps offer intriguing insights, but they lack details on specific events unfolding at university campuses. As I observed the evolving political landscape, I recognized an opportunity to enhance these maps. Following my departure from my previous group, I decided to pursue this project independently. This project aims to present a holistic view of the demonstrations unfolding across universities throughout the United States.

# Data Acquisition

## Overview

This section provides an overview of the process I took to acquire the data. I will also discuss any quality issues and filtering strategies used on the data set.

## The Acquisition

The data I used was downloaded from the Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) portal. This is an open data portal that I was able to access and download a geojson data file. I integrated the data set within my Visual Studio Code environment in order to filter the data. Since I only planned on documenting a small amount of the data provided, I decided to do a filter selection based on the name of the university. The only problem I encountered when filtering the data was being able to find the current university. Since many universities in similar areas have similar names, I had to be precise when finding the correct university variables to be used.

# Project limitations

As the sole contributor to this project, I encountered several limitations due to resource constraints. Firstly, not all major universities could be included. Secondly, sourcing reputable information for all university demonstrations proved challenging given the vast volume of articles on the subject. Lastly, reliance on available articles may have introduced potential inaccuracies into the data.

# Conclusion

I've documented 49 pro-Palestinian protests compared to just 8 pro-Israel protests, reflecting a significant 512% increase in support for Palestine. This disparity was anticipated given the current political climate and the nature of media coverage. An interesting aspect is the varied responses from university administrations: some strictly upheld the law, while others engaged in constructive dialogue with students. Many officials, however, faced backlash for their public statements, which inadvertently fueled support for Palestine.

Understanding the broader political context is essential for fostering meaningful discussions. I believe that students, faculty, and community members should unite in condemning violence and work collaboratively towards a better future. Despite the tensions between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups, we share many commonalities as humans. Emphasizing these shared values can help foster unity and understanding. Unfortunately, media often polarizes opinions, which can hinder productive conversations. By focusing on common ground, we can move towards a more harmonious and constructive dialogue.
