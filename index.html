        <h2>Documenting Major University Protests in Support of Palestine or Israel</h2>
    
        <div class="sidebar-section">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p class="sidbar-text">This interactive web map showcases the prominent universities across the United States and pinpoints locations where pro-Palestine and pro-Israel demonstrations have occurred. The map provides detailed information about major demonstrations on both sides, as documenting every protest instance proved impractical for this project. To identify significant protests, I considered two primary factors: the popularity of associated articles and the presence of multiple articles covering the event.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="sidebar-section">
            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <p class="sidbar-text">As the sole contributor to this project, I encountered several limitations due to resource constraints. Firstly, not all major universities could be included. Secondly, sourcing reputable information for all university demonstrations proved challenging given the vast volume of articles on the subject. Lastly, reliance on available articles may have introduced potential inaccuracies into the data.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="sidebar-section">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="sidbar-text">Among the protests I've documented, 40 have been in support of Palestine, while only 7 have supported Israel. This marks a significant 471% increase in pro-Palestinian demonstrations compared to those in support of Israel. These results were anticipated, given the prevailing political climate and media coverage on the topic.

                One interesting aspect I've observed is how university administrations have handled these protests. Some have opted for upholding the law, while others have engaged in dialogue with students. However, many officials have faced backlash for their public statements on the conflict, which has fueled support for Palestine. Understanding the political climate is crucial for fostering productive discussions.
                
                I hope that students, faculty, and community members can unite to condemn violence and collaborate on building a better future. Despite tensions between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups, we share many commonalities as humans. It's my belief that focusing on these shared values can help foster unity. The media only tries to polarize people and that often can prevent productive conversations.

                                        <p>October 12:</p>
                                        <p>This was the first free Palestine protest at the University of Washington since the conflict started again on October 7th. This protest was located at Red Square and hundreds of students, non-students, and media showed up. At this protest, there were some counter-protesters holding Israeli flags. According to the media, there were several fights that had to be broken up. An article of this event is located <a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/tensions-run-high-at-uw-pro-palestine-rally">here</a></p>
                                        <p>December 8th:</p>
                                        <p>This protest consisted of occupying Gerberding Hall throughout the day and into the evening. The protesters were located right outside of the University of Washington's president's office. Since the protesters refused to leave the cops were sent in and arrested 36 pro-palestine protesters.

                                        <p>April 4th:</p>
                                        <p>This protest consisted of protesters sitting in at the HUB overnight. The University of Washington decided to not intervene. The protesters put graffiti all over the HUB. The protesters peacefully left at around 5:30 am April 5th.

                                        <p>May 1st:</p>
                                        <p>This protest is an encampment that is set up by protesters to occupy the quad until their demands are met. The encampment seems to have grown since it started and the University officials seem to be silent currently. People at this encampment have been seen stealing and destroying Israeli flags and also blocking Jewish students from entering the encampment.

                                        <p>October:<p/>
                                        <p>Online videos have shown a tense confrontation between pro-Palestinian protesters at a Harvard student during an "die-in" event outside Harvard Business School on October 18. In the footage, protesters surround the student, attempting to block his view, and tensions escalate with physical contact and shouting. Reports suggest the student was filming demonstrators' faces, leading to his removal by protest organizers. Harvard Business School Dean Srikant Datar acknowledged the incident, stating that reports had been filed with the university's police department and the FBI. The confrontation adds to Harvard's ongoing controversy over its response to the Israel-Hamas war and a student letter holding Israel accountable for the conflict.<p/>

                                        <p>A group of pro-Palestine Jewish students and allies concluded a sit-in at Harvard University Hall after just over 24 hours. They demanded a ceasefire in Gaza, a statement differentiating antisemitism from anti-Zionism, and an investigation into Islamophobia and suppression of pro-Palestine speech on campus. Although the University did not meet their demands, the students received support from demonstrators and were provided with food by administrators. </p>

They urged Senator Warren to vote against military aid to Israel. Organized by various groups, the rally drew over 200 attendees, marching to Warren's home. Despite policy restrictions, the Harvard University Palestine Solidarity Committee raised awareness of the event, denouncing what they perceived as disproportionate scrutiny from the administration. Despite recent crackdowns, protesters reaffirmed their commitment to activism for Palestine.</p>

The event included chants, such as "Intifada," which some view as incitement to violence. A counterprotest of about 50 pro-Israeli students stood silently nearby, holding signs with photos of victims of Hamas. The pro-Palestinian protesters marched to Nassau Hall, where they were met by a man with an Israeli flag. The rally was the first major demonstration on campus related to the Gaza conflict since students returned from fall break.<p/>
