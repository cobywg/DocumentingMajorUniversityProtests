        <h2>Documenting Major University Protests in Support of Palestine or Israel</h2>
    
        <div class="sidebar-section">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>This interactive web map showcases the prominent universities across the United States and pinpoints locations where pro-Palestine and pro-Israel demonstrations have occurred. The map provides detailed information about major demonstrations on both sides, as documenting every protest instance proved impractical for this project. To identify significant protests, I considered two primary factors: the popularity of associated articles and the presence of multiple articles covering the event.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="sidebar-section">
            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <p>As the sole contributor to this project, I encountered several limitations due to resource constraints. Firstly, not all major universities could be included. Secondly, sourcing reputable information for all university demonstrations proved challenging given the vast volume of articles on the subject. Lastly, reliance on available articles may have introduced potential inaccuracies into the data.</p>

                                        <p>October 12:</p>
                                        <p>This was the first free Palestine protest at the University of Washington since the conflict started again on October 7th. This protest was located at Red Square and hundreds of students, non-students, and media showed up. At this protest, there were some counter-protesters holding Israeli flags. According to the media, there were several fights that had to be broken up. An article of this event is located <a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/tensions-run-high-at-uw-pro-palestine-rally">here</a></p>
                                        <p>December 8th:</p>
                                        <p>This protest consisted of occupying Gerberding Hall throughout the day and into the evening. The protesters were located right outside of the University of Washington's president's office. Since the protesters refused to leave the cops were sent in and arrested 36 pro-palestine protesters.

                                        <p>April 4th:</p>
                                        <p>This protest consisted of protesters sitting in at the HUB overnight. The University of Washington decided to not intervene. The protesters put graffiti all over the HUB. The protesters peacefully left at around 5:30 am April 5th.

                                        <p>May 1st:</p>
                                        <p>This protest is an encampment that is set up by protesters to occupy the quad until their demands are met. The encampment seems to have grown since it started and the University officials seem to be silent currently. People at this encampment have been seen stealing and destroying Israeli flags and also blocking Jewish students from entering the encampment.

                                        <p>The only demonstration on UW's campus that I was able to find was from October 7th when Jewish people met up at Red Square to mourn the lives lost on October 7th. Other than events there have been some counter-protesters seen at Palestinian protests but not any major protest in support of Israel or the Jewish people.<p/>

The students were asking for the administration to uphold their policies, make sure Jewish students can walk through the gates on campus and feel welcomed, and they called for equal rights for free speech.
