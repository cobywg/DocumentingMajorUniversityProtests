                                        <p>October 12:</p>
                                        <p>This was the first free Palestine protest at the University of Washington since the conflict started again on October 7th. This protest was located at Red Square and hundreds of students, non-students, and media showed up. At this protest, there were some counter-protesters holding Israeli flags. According to the media, there were several fights that had to be broken up. An article of this event is located <a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/tensions-run-high-at-uw-pro-palestine-rally">here</a></p>
                                        <p>December 8th:</p>
                                        <p>This protest consisted of occupying Gerberding Hall throughout the day and into the evening. The protesters were located right outside of the University of Washington's president's office. Since the protesters refused to leave the cops were sent in and arrested 36 pro-palestine protesters.

                                        <p>April 4th:</p>
                                        <p>This protest consisted of protesters sitting in at the HUB overnight. The University of Washington decided to not intervene. The protesters put graffiti all over the HUB. The protesters peacefully left at around 5:30 am April 5th.

                                        <p>May 1st:</p>
                                        <p>This protest is an encampment that is set up by protesters to occupy the quad until their demands are met. The encampment seems to have grown since it started and the University officials seem to be silent currently. People at this encampment have been seen stealing and destroying Israeli flags and also blocking Jewish students from entering the encampment.

                                        <p>The only demonstration on UW's campus that I was able to find was from October 7th when Jewish people met up at Red Square to mourn the lives lost on October 7th. Other than events there have been some counter-protesters seen at Palestinian protests but not any major protest in support of Israel or the Jewish people.<p/>

                                        <p>On October 26th around 400 students at Berkeley walked out in solidarity with Palestine. This rally was located at Sproul Plaza. The protesters called for a cease-fire and to divest from arms manufacturers that create weapons used by the Israel Defense Force. Many chants were made during the protest. For instance, one of them was “Israel, Israel, you can’t hide. We charge you with genocide”. This protest marked the start of many Berkeley students supporting the Palastinians in Gaza.<p/>
